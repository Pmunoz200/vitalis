## üöÄ App Features <a name = "app_features"></a>

### **Multi-Modal Logging**
- Users can log data through video, audio, and text inputs, leveraging Gemini's advanced multi-modal capabilities. This feature simplifies the process of tracking food intake and exercise activities, reducing manual input errors and saving time.

### **Personalized Suggestions**
- The app offers customized recommendations tailored to individual goals and preferences. Whether it‚Äôs suggesting a 400-calorie dinner to meet daily nutritional targets or recommending a workout routine to align with fitness goals, the app delivers precise and actionable insights.

### **Minimal Input**
- The user interface is designed for simplicity, making health management intuitive and stress-free. The app minimizes the need for complex manual inputs, ensuring that users can focus on their wellbeing rather than data entry.

### **All-in-One Solution**
- Vitalis integrates food, exercise, and other wellbeing features into a single platform. This all-in-one solution ensures that users have everything they need for comprehensive health management without the need for multiple separate applications.

### **Enhanced Accuracy**
- By harnessing the power of Gemini, the app ensures more accurate data logging for both food and exercise activities. This feature is particularly beneficial for users who struggle with estimating portion sizes or exercise intensity.

### **Future Focus Areas**
- The app will expand to include habit tracking, meditation, and sleep management features, further enhancing its holistic approach to health and wellness.

## ‚ú® Gemini: The Key Differentiator <a name = "gemini-the-key-differentiator"></a>

Gemini, Google‚Äôs state-of-the-art multi-modal AI, is the key differentiator that sets Project Vitalis apart from other health and wellness apps. Here's why:

- **Multi-Modal Input**: Gemini supports multiple forms of input, including text, video, and audio, making it easier for users to log their health data in the way that suits them best. This flexibility enhances the user experience by reducing the barriers to accurate data entry.

- **Long Context Understanding**: Gemini's ability to process and analyze long contexts allows the app to provide suggestions based on extensive tracking histories and multiple health aspects. This means that users receive more informed and tailored advice, taking into account their overall health journey rather than just isolated data points.

- **High Accuracy**: By leveraging Gemini's advanced AI capabilities, Project Vitalis ensures that the health recommendations and data interpretations are highly accurate. This level of precision is crucial for users who rely on the app to make informed decisions about their diet, exercise, and overall wellness.

## üõ† Technology Stack <a name = "technology_stack"></a>

The technology stack used in Project Vitalis includes:

- **Flutter**: A UI toolkit from Google that enables the development of natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase. Flutter powers the client-side of the Vitalis app, ensuring a smooth and responsive user interface.

- **Firebase Authentication**: A robust and secure authentication system from Google, used to manage user sign-in, sign-up, and authentication processes in the app. This ensures that user data is protected and accessible only to authorized users.

- **Firebase Firestore Database**: A flexible, scalable database for mobile, web, and server development from Firebase. Firestore is used to store and sync user data in real-time, making it integral to the backend of the app for managing health logs, user profiles, and personalized recommendations.

- **Firebase Functions**: A serverless framework from Firebase that allows the backend code to be deployed and executed in response to events, automatically scaling up as needed. It handles the backend processing and communication with Gemini AI.

- **Gemini (Google AI)**: Gemini is Google‚Äôs state-of-the-art multi-modal AI model that powers the app‚Äôs core functionalities. It enables the app to process and understand various forms of input (text, video, audio), providing personalized and accurate health recommendations and improving the overall user experience.

## üöß Limitations and Future Work <a name = "limitations-and-future-work"></a>

### **Limitations**
- **Text-Only Logging**: Currently, the server only supports logging with text. However, the app is designed to easily incorporate other input methods like video and audio in the future.
- **Local Server Deployment**: The server is not deployed online and is intended for local use only due to budget constraints, particularly involving the deployment and subscription to Gemini's API.
- **Limited Features**: At this stage, only exercise and food tracking are available. Other aspects of health management are not yet implemented.

### **Future Work**
- **Multi-Modal Logging**: Expand the server to support logging via video, audio, and other input methods to fully leverage the multi-modal capabilities of Gemini.
- **Full Deployment**: Plan to deploy the server online, including a subscription to Gemini‚Äôs API to make the app fully operational and accessible to a broader audience.
- **Comprehensive Health Features**: Future development will focus on creating a complete all-in-one holistic health app that covers all aspects of wellbeing, beyond just exercise and food.
