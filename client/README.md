## ‚ú® Features <a name = "features"></a>

- **User Enrollment**: New users go through an enrollment process on their first login, where they answer personal questions such as age, weight, exercise routines, eating preferences, and available exercise spaces.
- **Personalized Communication**: Based on the collected data, the app establishes a tailored communication process using Gemini AI to provide customized health recommendations.
- **Daily Chat Interactions**: Each day, users start a new chat with the AI, which also considers the information from previous interactions to offer more relevant advice.
- **User Data Management**: Users can manage and update their personal data to refine the recommendations and insights provided by the AI.
- **Secure Authentication**: Login and authentication are handled securely through Google and Firebase.
- **Data Sync**: User data is automatically synced with Firebase Firestore, ensuring that all information is up-to-date and accessible across devices.
- **In-App Media Capture**: Capture and upload images and audio directly within the app for tracking progress and sharing updates.
- **Intuitive Interface**: The app features a responsive and user-friendly design, making it easy to navigate and interact with the AI.

## ‚õìÔ∏è Dependencies <a name = "dependencies"></a>

This project relies on the following Flutter and Dart packages:

- `firebase_auth`: For user authentication via Firebase.
- `firebase_core`: Core functionalities for Firebase.
- `google_sign_in`: Google Sign-In integration.
- `cloud_firestore`: Firestore for data storage.
- `flutter_sound`: To capture and play audio files.
- `permission_handler`: To manage access permissions to media.
- `fluttertoast`: To display toast messages.
- `image_picker`: To capture or select images from the gallery.
- `provider`: State management.
- `carousel_slider`: To create image carousels.
- `intl`: Internationalization support.
- `drop_cap_text`: To style text with drop caps.

## üöß Limitations <a name = "limitations"></a>

- **Internet Dependency**: The app relies on an internet connection for most functionalities, including real-time data synchronization and communication with the AI. Offline usage is limited and may not support all features.
- **Data Storage Constraints**: The current implementation utilizes Firebase's free tier, which has restrictions on storage capacity and database operations. Users with extensive data needs may encounter limitations related to storage and performance.
- **Privacy and Data Security**: While Firebase provides secure data handling, users must be aware of the privacy implications of storing personal health data in the cloud.
- **Initial Enrollment Complexity**: The initial data collection during the enrollment process might be seen as intrusive by some users, potentially affecting user experience and adoption.

## üöÄ Future Scope <a name = "future_scope"></a>

Planned improvements and future developments:

- **Expanded Data Tracking**: Introduce tracking for additional health metrics, such as sleep patterns and hydration levels, to provide a more comprehensive health profile.
- **Integration with Wearables**: Allow integration with wearable devices to automatically sync exercise data, heart rate, and other vital statistics.
- **Offline Functionality**: Improve the offline mode, enabling users to interact with the AI and track their progress even without an internet connection, with automatic syncing once reconnected.
- **Audio and Video Support**: Add support for audio and video content, allowing users to record and review exercise sessions and food, and receive AI-generated feedback.
- **Localization and Accessibility**: Expand language support and improve accessibility features to make the app usable by a broader audience.
- **Customizable Notifications**: Implement a more advanced notification system that allows users to customize reminders and updates based on their personal preferences.
