**Response:**

{
  "content": "You've had three eggs for breakfast, which is a good source of protein. Each egg provides approximately 70 calories, 6 grams of protein, and 5 grams of fat. This means your breakfast has contributed about 210 calories, 18 grams of protein, and 15 grams of fat to your daily intake. While eggs are a nutritious choice, it's important to remember that they are relatively high in cholesterol. It's a good idea to balance your intake with other foods that are lower in cholesterol and saturated fat. You haven't tracked any other food yet today, so it's important to keep track of your food intake throughout the day to ensure you're getting enough nutrients and calories to meet your needs."
